Development Notes
This mod uses a soft dependency approach to Pixelmon integration:

We don't directly reference Pixelmon classes at compile time
We use NBT data to store effects that Pixelmon can read
The mod will work even without Pixelmon, but the effects will only function when Pixelmon is present

To add actual Pixelmon integration, you would:

Add Pixelmon as a development dependency
Implement proper event handlers for Pixelmon events
Update the PixelmonCompat class to use actual Pixelmon API calls
